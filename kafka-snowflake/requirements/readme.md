- **Libraries**: The following Python libraries are required:
  - `kafka-python` - For interacting with Kafka
  - `snowflake-connector-python` - For connecting to Snowflake
  - `pandas` - For data manipulation
  - `json` - For parsing JSON
  - `logging` - For logging application events
  - `faker` - For generating fake data
  - `time` - For handling time-related operations
